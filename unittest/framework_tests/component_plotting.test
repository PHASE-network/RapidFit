Running this XML should produce a Projection plot where the components read from left to right in decending order with only the 1st and 3rd peaks expressing their components

All components should have a unique color with line width of 3 with the 0th component not being plotted on the overall plot

There should be no Foam files left if the destructors are all called correctly
