# RapidFit
Maximum log-likelihood fitting

RapidFit is a C++ framework for performing maximum log-likelihood fitting, as is often used in particle physics data analysis. It provides a set of pre-defined probability density functions that can be used to build a custom PDF to fit to a data set. New PDFs can be added by the user. The configuration of the PDF fit model, data import and parameter definition is controlled via an XML file. Common functions that are typical for particle physics data analysis (plotting of the function, maximum likelihood scans in 1/2D and toy studies) are simple to configure and run.
